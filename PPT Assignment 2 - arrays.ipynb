    "The `isMonotonic` function takes an input `nums`, which is the given integer array.\n",

    "We initialize two boolean variables, `is_increasing` and `is_decreasing`, as True. These variables will keep track of whether the array is non-increasing or non-decreasing, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate through the elements of the array starting from index 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each element `nums[i]`, we compare it with the previous element `nums[i-1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `nums[i]` is less than `nums[i-1]`, it means the array is not non-increasing (monotone increasing), so we set `is_increasing` to False.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `nums[i]` is greater than nums`[i-1]`, it means the array is not non-decreasing (monotone decreasing), so we set `is_decreasing` to False.\n",
    "\n",
    "After iterating through all the elements, we check if either is_increasing or is_decreasing is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "If either of them is True, it means the array is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing. In this case, the function returns True.\n",
    "\n",
    "If both `is_increasing` and `is_decreasing` are False, it means the array is neither monotone increasing nor monotone decreasing. In this case, the function returns False.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given example, the array nums =`[1, 2, 2, 3]` is provided. The function determines that the array is non-decreasing (monotone increasing) since all adjacent elements are either equal or in increasing order. Therefore, the function returns True as the output."

    "The `minScore` function takes two inputs: `nums`, which is the given integer array, and `k`, which is the integer range for the operation.\n",
