    "#### Explanation\n",
    "Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function `twoSum` takes two parameters: `nums`, which is the input array of integers, and `target`,\n",
    "which is the target sum we want to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inside the function, we create an empty dictionary called `num_indices`.\n",
    "This dictionary will store the elements of the array as keys and their indices as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We then iterate through the array `nums` using the `enumerate` function.\n",
    "The `enumerate` function provides both the index and value of each element in the array for each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For each element `num` at index `i`, we calculate the complement by subtracting `num` from the `target` value.\n",
    "The complement represents the value we need to find in the array that, when added to `num`, gives the target sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We check if the complement exists in the `num_indices` dictionary by using the `in` operator.\n",
    "If it does, it means we have found a pair of numbers that add up to the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If the complement exists in the dictionary, we return a list containing the indices of the current element `num` and\n",
    "its complement from the `num_indices` dictionary. The index of the complement is retrieved using `num_indices[complement]`, and the index of the current element is `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If the complement does not exist in the dictionary, we add the current element `num` to the `num_indices` dictionary,\n",
    "with its index `i` as the value. This allows us to keep track of the indices of previously visited elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If we have iterated through the entire array without finding a pair that adds up to the target, we return an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of the `twoSum` function with the given example input.\n",
    "We pass the `nums` array `[2, 7, 11, 15]` and the target value `9` to the function. The returned result is stored in the `result` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. We then print the result, which should be `[0, 1]`, indicating that the numbers at indices 0 and 1\n",
    "in the `nums` array add up to the target value of 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm utilizes the two-pointer technique, which allows it to find the pair of numbers\n",
    "with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.\n",
    "By using a dictionary to store the elements and their indices, we can efficiently check for the complement in constant time."

    "\n",
    "We move the element to the beginning of the array by assigning `nums[i]` to `nums[k]`. This effectively shifts the element to the left, overwriting the elements that are equal to val.\n",
    "\n",
    "After moving the element, we `increment k by 1` to indicate that we have found another element not equal to val.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we finish iterating through the array, we have moved all the elements not equal to val to the beginning of the array, and k represents the number of such elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We return `k` as the result.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We enter a `while` loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right. \n",
    "This condition ensures that there is still a valid range to search within.\n",

    "We repeat steps 4-7 until the target is found or the range is exhausted (i.e., left becomes greater than right).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the target is not found in the array, we return left as the index where the target would be inserted in order. This is because left represents the rightmost index that is less than the target, so inserting the target at left + 1 would maintain the sorted order.\n",
