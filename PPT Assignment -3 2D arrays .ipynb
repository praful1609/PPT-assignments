    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function `findCommonElements` takes three sorted arrays, `arr1`, `arr2`, and `arr3`, as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Three pointers, `ptr1`, `ptr2`, and `ptr3`, are initialized to 0, representing the starting index of each array.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. An empty array, `result`, is created to store the common elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The while loop continues as long as all three pointers (`ptr1`, `ptr2`, and `ptr3`) are within the bounds of their respective arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Inside the while loop, the code checks if the elements at the current positions of `ptr1`, `ptr2`, and `ptr3` are equal. If they are equal, it means that the current element is present in all three arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In that case, the element is appended to the `result` array, and all three pointers are incremented to move to the next elements in each array.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If the elements at `ptr1`, `ptr2`, and `ptr3` are not equal, the code checks which element is the smallest among the three. The pointer corresponding to the smallest element is incremented to move to the next element in that particular array.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. This process continues until any of the pointers reaches the end of its respective array.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Finally, the `result` array, which contains the common elements, is returned as the output of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given example, the code compares the three arrays [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 2, 5, 7, 9], and [1, 3, 4, 5, 8].\n",

    "The code iterates through the arrays using the pointers `ptr1`, `ptr2`, and `ptr3`. It identifies that 1 and 5 are the only elements present in all three arrays, and these elements are appended to the `result` array.\n",

    "Finally, the `result` array [1, 5] is returned as the output, which represents the sorted array of integers that appeared in all three input arrays."

    "1. The function `transposeMatrix` takes a 2D integer array `matrix` as input.\n",

    "2. The code determines the dimensions of the original matrix by getting the number of rows and the number of columns. These values are stored in the variables `rows` and `columns`, respectively.\n",

    "### Explanation\n",
    "1. The function `rearrangeArray` takes two parameters: `nums`, which is the input array, and `n`, which represents half the length of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An empty array `result` is initialized to store the rearranged elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The code iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`, since we need to rearrange the first `n` elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inside the loop, the code performs two actions for each iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - It appends `nums[i]` to the `result` array. This corresponds to taking the `i`th element from the first half of `nums` (xi).\n",
    "   - It appends `nums[i+n]` to the `result` array. This corresponds to taking the `i`th element from the second half of `nums` (yi).\n",
    "\n",
    "   By doing this, the code interleaves the elements from the first half and the second half of `nums` in the desired form.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After iterating through all the elements, the `result` array contains the rearranged elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The `result` array is then returned as the output of the function.\n",
